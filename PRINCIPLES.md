# Principles of Sober Dialogue

## 1. Boundaries of Freedom
Your freedom ends where another person's freedom begins.

## 2. Freedom and Responsibility
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from responsibility and does not equal absolute anarchy.

## 3. Subjectivity of Humor
What seems funny to you is not necessarily funny to others.

## 4. Uniqueness of Experience
If you have a certain position, quality, opinion, or type of thinking, it doesn't mean everyone else has it.

## 5. Self-Check Before Publishing
Before any message or comment, think:
- "Does this violate the law?"
- "How would I react if this were written to me?"

## 6. Culture of Apologies
Apologizing is not shame or weakness, but a healthy practice that increases authority.

## 7. Explaining Criticism and Defense
When criticizing or defending something, explain soberly and in detail.
