# AnmiTali Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our Code of Conduct to be honored.

## Our Standards

### Fundamental Principles

**Respect for Boundaries**
Your freedom ends where another person's freedom begins. All community members must respect the rights, opinions, and personal space of others.

**Freedom with Responsibility**
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from responsibility and does not equal absolute anarchy. All participants are accountable for their words and actions.

**Subjectivity Recognition**
What seems funny, obvious, or correct to you is not necessarily so for others. Acknowledge that perspectives, humor, and values differ among individuals.

**Experience Diversity**
If you have a certain position, quality, opinion, or type of thinking, it does not mean that everyone else does. Avoid projecting your personal experience as universal.

**Thoughtful Communication**
Before posting any message or comment, consider:
- "Does this violate any laws?"
- "How would I react if someone wrote this to me?"
- "Does this contribute constructively to the discussion?"

**Constructive Accountability**
Apologizing is not shame or weakness but a healthy practice that increases credibility and trust within the community.

**Reasoned Discourse**
When criticizing or defending something, provide clear, fact-based explanations rather than emotional reactions.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions
- Attempt collaboration before conflict
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants
- Base arguments on facts rather than emotions
- Acknowledge limitations of your knowledge
- Remain open to changing your opinion when presented with new evidence
- Focus criticism on ideas and behaviors, not individuals
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences

## Unacceptable Behavior

### Serious Violations (immediate sanctions):
- Direct threats of physical violence or harm
- Doxxing (publishing personal information without consent)
- Sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual comments
- Discriminatory statements aimed at humiliation based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability
- Posting illegal content

### Significant Violations (warning or temporary sanctions):
- Systematic ignoring of opponent's arguments while repeating one's position (more than 3 times in one discussion)
- Personal attacks instead of discussing arguments ("you're stupid" instead of "this statement is incorrect because...")
- Attempts to disrupt discussion through flooding, spam, or repetitive provocative messages
- Categorical statements without providing sources when directly requested
- Refusing to follow self-check rule after moderator warning

### Minor Violations (reminder of rules):
- Using sarcasm or irony in a way that could be perceived as offensive
- Ignoring requests for clarification of one's position
- Generalizations based on personal experience without caveats ("everyone knows", "obviously")

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

### Graduated Sanctions System:

**For Minor Violations:**
- First violation: Public reminder of rules with explanation
- Repeated violations: Personal warning from moderator

**For Significant Violations:**
- First violation: Official warning with record keeping
- Second violation: Temporary participation restriction (1-7 days)
- Third violation: Temporary participation restriction (1-4 weeks)

**For Serious Violations:**
- Immediate temporary participation restriction (1-4 weeks) or permanent exclusion depending on severity

### Limitations on Moderator Powers:
- Moderators cannot apply sanctions above their authority level without approval
- Decisions on permanent exclusion are made collectively by at least 3 moderators
- All sanctions must be documented with reasons and evidence

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. All reports will be handled with discretion.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names of any witnesses
- Your account of what occurred
- Any additional helpful information

## Addressing Grievances and Appeal Procedures

### Appeal Process:
1. **Filing an Appeal:** Within 72 hours of the sanction through the official channel
2. **Review:** Appeals are reviewed by moderators who did not participate in the original decision
3. **Timeline:** Appeal decisions are made within 7 days
4. **Outcome:** Sanctions may be overturned, reduced, or upheld

### Moderation Team Structure:
- Chief Moderator (makes final decisions on disputed matters)
- Level 1 Moderators (can apply sanctions up to official warning)
- Level 2 Moderators (can apply temporary restrictions up to 4 weeks)

### Fair Process Principles:
- Right to explain one's position before sanctions are applied
- Presumption of good faith until proven otherwise
- Proportionality of sanctions to violation severity
- Possibility of rehabilitation for most violations

## Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

1. Take time to consider the other person's perspective
2. Ensure you understand their position before responding
3. Focus on the substance of ideas rather than personalities
4. Seek common ground and compromise where possible
5. Escalate to moderators only when necessary

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, both online and offline. This includes project repositories, forums, social media accounts, and community events.
